# 🌴 My 15-Day Python Summer Party Adventure 🌴

Welcome! This repository is more than just a collection of code; it's the chronicle of a 15-day data analysis expedition I embarked on as part of Interview Master's **Python Summer Party**.

Think of this as my travel journal. For fifteen consecutive days, I dove headfirst into a new data challenge. Each morning brought a unique puzzle, a fresh dataset to tame, and a new opportunity to sharpen my skills. This wasn't just about writing code, It was about analytical thinking, persistence, and the joy of uncovering insights hidden within the numbers.

My primary tools for this adventure were the formidable duo of data science:
* **pandas**: My trusty Swiss Army knife for wrangling, cleaning, and structuring data.
* **numpy**: The powerful engine for all things numerical, ensuring my calculations were swift and efficient.

Inside this repository, you'll find my daily logs i.e., the Jupyter Notebooks - one for each day of the challenge. They capture not just the final solution, but the story of my thought process, from initial exploration to the final, polished answer.

This journey was a testament to my commitment, problem-solving abilities, and passion for telling stories with data. I invite you to explore the notebooks and see how I navigated the twists and turns of each challenge.

## 🗺️ How to Explore My Journey

Ready to retrace my steps? You can run any of the notebooks on your own machine. Here’s how:

1.  **Set up Your Camp:** Create and activate a fresh Python environment.
    *Using venv:*
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
    *Or using conda:*
    ```bash
    conda create -n summerparty python=3.9
    conda activate summerparty
    ```

2.  **Gather Your Tools:** Install the necessary libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab pandas numpy
    ```

3.  **Launch the Expedition:** Start Jupyter and open any `day-XX.ipynb` file to see that day's adventure unfold.
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

## How to use

1. Create and activate a Python environment (venv or conda).
2. Install dependencies:
   
   pip install jupyterlab pandas numpy
   
3. Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook and open any `day-XX.ipynb` file.
